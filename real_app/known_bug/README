'tac' is part of GNU Coreutils and is licenced under the GPL v3 (see COPYING_tac).
These binaries were compiled using bunny-gcc (see 'bunny' directory), but their source code was not altered in any way. The main file, 'tac.c', is provided in this directory.
You can get the original, complete source code (coreutils 5.1) from:
 * gnu.org: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/
 * or as we did, launching 'apt-get source coreutils/stable' on Debian Squeeze. Don't forget to apply the 5.1 patch.
