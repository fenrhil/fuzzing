Requirements:

Building rutc:
Use make to build rutc.

Running rutc:
After rutc is built, execute it by typing ./rutc

Description
rutc is a calculator that allows interpretation of expressions and control
statements. It can understand real and complex numbers in several bases, solve linear equations, and has a statistics mode. Many pre-defined constants and functions are provided, and if these are not enough, you can define your own.
Execution control is provided by if-else statements,while and for constructs. For more information, see Control Statements.

Using rutc:
Just type in an expression, and away you go!
Expressions may have the following operators:
+, -, *, /, %, ^
?:
int, div
==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
sqrt, exp, log, ln
sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
arg, real, imag, conj
C, P
|.|

Apart from these, rutc provides user-defined functions.
A function can be defined as:
func name(variable list) = expression
Eg:
func f(x, y) = ln(x)/ln(y)

rutc also provides if-else, while and for statements:

An if-else statement has the form:
if(expression) statement
or
if(expression) { statement list }

A while statement is written as:
while(expression) statement
or
while(expression) { statement list }

and a for statement:
for(init statement; expression; final statement) statement
and is equivalent to
init statement
while(expression) { statement list
final statement
}
